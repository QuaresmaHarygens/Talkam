# Talkam Liberia Monetization Strategy

## Objectives
- Keep core citizen reporting free.
- Offer mission-aligned revenue options that benefit NGOs, government responders, and media partners without compromising safety.

## Model 1: Insight Subscriptions (NGO/Government)
- **Tiers:**
  - *Essential:* live map, CSV exports up to 1,000 rows, automated alerts per county.
  - *Professional:* adds verification API access, custom dashboards, role-based seats.
  - *Mission Control:* dedicated data lake sync, SLA, on-prem deployment option.
- **Packaging:** seat-based + feature toggles (analytics depth, API quotas).
- **Pros:** predictable revenue, aligns with stakeholders' need for data.
- **Cons:** requires rigorous data governance, risk of perceived paywall on insights.

## Model 2: Sponsored Community Programs & Grants
- **Implementation:** branded community verification drives, safety trainings, NGO-funded radio/SMS campaigns.
- **Pros:** mission-aligned, supports rural outreach and literacy efforts.
- **Cons:** variable funding cycles, grant reporting overhead.
- **Packaging Suggestions:** bronze/silver/gold sponsorship levels tied to reach (counties covered, co-branded alerts, reporting on impact metrics).

## Model 3: Ethical Services Marketplace
- **Offerings:**
  - Verified journalist/NGO badge review services.
  - Local job & event postings vetted for civic impact.
  - Paid escalation hotline for corporate social responsibility teams.
- **Pros:** diversifies revenue, empowers trusted actors, scalable digitally.
- **Cons:** requires stringent moderation to avoid commercial spam.
- **Packaging:** credit bundles (lite/standard/premium) with defined number of badges reviewed, posts, or escalations.

## Pricing Guidance
- Use qualitative labels in communications (e.g., *Community*, *Impact*, *Nationwide* packages) and finalize currency amounts post-market testing with stakeholders.

## Safeguards
- Revenue features never block critical safety information.
- Transparent financial reports shared with civil society advisory board.
- Opt-out for users to avoid branded content in crisis alerts.
